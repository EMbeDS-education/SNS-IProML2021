    "## Predictive Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic regression\n",
    "Logistic regression is called a generalized linear models. ie.: it is a linear model with a link\n",
    "function that maps the output of linear multiple regression to the posterior probability of class\n",
    "1 𝑝(1|𝑥) using the logistic sigmoid function: 𝑝(1|𝑤, 𝑥𝑖) = 1/1 + exp(−𝑤 · 𝑥𝑖)\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small).\" [ wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector - linear\n",
    "It simply finds a line or curve (in two dimensions) or manifold (in multiple dimensions) that divides the classes from each other. A linear discriminative classifier would attempt to draw a straight line separating the two sets of data, and thereby create a model for classification. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)\n",
    " \n",
    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "It relies on Bayes's theorem. In Bayesian classification, we're interested in finding the probability of a label given some observed features, which we can write as $P(L~|~{\\rm features})$. \n",
    " Such a model is called a generative model because it specifies the hypothetical random process that generates the data. In Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, the assumption is that data from each label is drawn from a simple Gaussian distribution. Gaussian distribution is used as prior probability distribution to compute the posterior probability  $P(L~|~{\\rm features})$\n",
    " \n",
    "### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "Gradient boosting is an ensemble algorithm that fits boosted decision trees by minimizing an error gradient.\n",
    "Decision trees can be added together (sequentially) to correct for errors in the predictions. The output of the other learning algorithms ('weak learners') is combined into a weighted sum that represents the final output of the boosted classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Network\n",
    "A MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network. An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable."
